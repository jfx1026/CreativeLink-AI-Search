            <p>I started drawing logos when the visual onslaught of skateboarding's high-energy, visual language came into my teenage world. I was immediately organizing events and embracing the culture through every creative outlet at my disposal.</p>
            <p>What I didn't know then was my tendency towards organization, highlighting others, and celebrating culture would follow me for many years. I recently founded <a href="#" class="text-link">Tails Of...</a> magazine which investigates skateboarding and art, highlighting some of the best creatives in the subculture.</p>

            <h3 class="journey-title">Art School & Teaching</h3>
            <p>In art school, I studied architecture, and the analytical nature of the architecture education affected my creative process and laid the foundation of how I approach design. No decision is made in a vacuum. The medium and the messaging are always intertwined.</p>
            <p>At RISD, I explored all disciplines and taught myself all the design software. In between making models, I started a skateboard company that sold products worldwide. Before I graduated, I stumbled into teaching and was teaching college courses myself which led to years of teaching design.</p>

            <h3 class="journey-title">SPACE1026 — Philadelphia</h3>
            <p>By the end of my college career, I knew the architecture field wasn't for me. A few friends and I moved to Philadelphia and founded <a href="#" class="text-link">SPACE1026</a>, an art studio and gallery. SPACE1026 became a meeting ground of emerging art, skateboarding, and design and we showcased the work of many artists early in their careers.</p>
            <p>I started work as a production graphic designer in ad agencies and taught myself web design along the way. I worked as a temp designer and with each assignment, I started creating a mental catalog of efficiencies, creative process, and best practices.</p>

            <p>Philadelphia was a great place to grow and I worked with a lot of talented people who helped me develop my skills. I was very lucky to land at Visit Philly as a web designer and quickly became the creative director, creating marketing in all media at a scale that I hadn't dreamed of previously.</p>
            <p>This was my first opportunity to lead a team and I quickly realized the impact of design leadership. That team is still connected to this day.</p>

            <p>My California adventure started in San Diego in what I call, "my thirteen-year-old dream job" at Black Box Distribution. I managed everything digital for several skateboard brands and started to flex my digital muscles expanding into e-commerce, social, and content.</p>
            <p>NorCal called and I jumped deeper into e-commerce, product design, and started to explore A/B testing, personalization, and optimization.</p>

            <p>Over the years, I've bounced back and forth between manager roles and individual contributor roles. In my most recent role at Apple, I was an individual contributor working on global projects with a level of scale in the billions. The work itself was complex and required a system-level thinking that I enjoyed but I missed working with a team, managing and mentoring young designers.</p>
            <p>I taught a class at CCA in the graduate interaction program and it felt good to be back in a classroom working alongside the students. Currently, I'm the Director of Design at <a href="#" class="text-link">Art of Problem Solving</a> where I'm building a team that's tackling multiple digital products along with in-person learning experiences.</p>
